# Glove Mouse
In this project, I have created a working prototype of a wearable glove mouse using Arduino Leonardo which using an accelerometer to control the position of the mouse pointer on the screen and flex sensors to initiate the clicks. 
The repository contains simple code to implement a wired glove mouse.

I have made the mouse wireless using Bluetooth module HC-05 and added more flexibility and functionality by adding Windows shortcut keys using capacitive touch sensors on finger tips.

Here is a link to the demo of the wired glove mouse:
